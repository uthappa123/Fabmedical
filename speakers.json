She has organised and performed genetic and genomic studies in HD and AD, analysed mouse models of disease and determined the biological mechanisms through which the diseases work, to identify new targets for therapies. In AD her pathway analysis papers highlighted the aetiological contribution of the immune system to AD that now forms a key area of therapeutic research. In HD her leadership in the Genetic Modifiers of HD consortium and in other repeat diseases provide novel avenues for therapeutic exploitation in DNA repair that inform her current research.","company":"Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, UK","first":"Lesley","hidden":false,"inShow":"none","last":"Jones","photo":"speaker2.jpg","speakerID":1125,"title":"Prof"}

He is a fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences and an NIHR senior investigator. His first degree was in physics and physiology from Cambridge University. He graduated in medicine from the University of London and subsequently specialised in cognitive neurology. He has longstanding clinical and research interests in neurodegenerative dementia and has published over 300 peer-reviewed papers. A research focus has been the use of neuroimaging to assess the earliest changes in dementia and to track progression. He developed novel techniques of image analysis for atrophy measurements from serial MRI, which have been widely used in longitudinal studies and trials in neurodegenerative disorders. He has interests in clinical and biomarker studies more generally with on-going multimodal longitudinal at-risk cohort studies in familial AD, frontotemporal dementia, and normal aging. Nick serves on the steering group of Dementias Platform UK. He has advised the European Medicines Agency, the US FDA, and a number of clinical trials. He was a member of the Prime Minister’s Dementia Research Champions Group. He chairs UCL’s Dementia Strategy Board and co-chairs the Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre at Queen Square. He co-chairs the Alzheimer’s Society’s Research Strategy Council","company":"University College London, London, UK","first":"Nick","hidden":false,"inShow":"none","last":"Fox","photo":"speaker3.jpg","speakerID":1179,"title":"Prof"}
